    ## ü•ù The Kiwi Charge Advantage

    ‚ö° Within the **{round(max(result[2]), 2)} hours** that the simulation ran for, the **{num_robots.value} kiwi(s) were able to charge {sum(result[1])} unique cars in a day**. The Kiwi provided {sum(result[4])} kWh in total across all the cars, adding {round(sum(result[4])*0.16, 2)} km of range across the parking lot.

    üöó In a month, {num_robots.value} kiwi(s) would service **{sum(result[1])*3} unique cars of the same charging needs, which is {frac_charged_month}% of your parking lot.**

    ‚è±Ô∏è Installing fixed chargers is a time intensive process, that takes anywhere between **12-24 months**. With Kiwi Charge, you will only need **1-3 business days** to electrify the entire parking lot!

    üí∞ With {total_cars} cars on your parking lot, **your building would have needed {total_cars} level 2** fixed chargers, which would **cost you {formatted_fixed_cost} **in just hardware costs. However, **with Kiwi Charge**, you can **service the cars in your parking lot at level 3 speeds, at a complete price of {formatted_cost}** ({num_robots.value} kiwi bot(s)).

    * _Kiwi Capacity: Units are 45-kW, and dispense/recharge themselves at Level 3 speeds_
