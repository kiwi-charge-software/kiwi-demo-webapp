    ## üß† Simulation Assumptions

    This simulation is not perfect -- but it does assume the worst-case. Our more accurate models will include Kiwi smart charging capabilities, allowing it to charge more vehicles than it does in this simulation.

    We assume:

    1) Kiwis are operating at random to charge the vehicles-- there is no "smart" charging to _efficiently_ charge cars

    2) Kiwi units are assumed to be a 45-kW unit, dispensing and recharging itself at Level 3 speeds

    3) Vehicles are set to be at a consistent battery capacity (70 kWh) - there is no variation in user battery size.

    4) All vehicles are present at the time of charging, and configured correctly - there's no missing/misconfigured vehicles.

    * Number of vehicles that require 20%, 40%, and 60% charge

    ## ü§ñ Simulation Results

    ü•ù It took {num_robots.value} kiwi(s) {round(max(result[2]), 2)} hours to charge {sum(result[1])} unique cars.

    üöò It was able to charge **{round((sum(result[1])/(cars_20.value + cars_40.value + cars_60.value))*100, 2)}**% of the cars on the parking lot.

    ‚ö° The Kiwi dispensed **{sum(result[4])}** kWh total.

    ------
    ## üíµ Cost breakdown

    üí∞ If you had placed fixed chargers to service the {sum(result[1])} unique cars, it would have cost you **{formatted_fixed_cost}**.

    üîñ With Kiwi Charge, you will be paying **{formatted_cost}** to service the same cars. This results in {formatted_savings} of savings for you!


    -----
    ## ‚è±Ô∏è Time breakdown
    üìâ Installing fixed chargers is a time intensive process, that takes anywhere between **12-24 months**. 

    üìà With Kiwi Charge, you will only need **1-3 business days** to replace {sum(result[1])} fixed chargers!
